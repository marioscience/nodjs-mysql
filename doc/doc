The API has a get method that returns all records by default.
http://localhost:8080/transactions

The query can be filtered by date ranges:
http://localhost:8080/transactions?dateRange=lastDay
http://localhost:8080/transactions?dateRange=lastThreeDays
http://localhost:8080/transactions?dateRange=lastWeek
http://localhost:8080/transactions?dateRange=lastMonth


by amount:
http://localhost:8080/transactions?amountGt=200
http://localhost:8080/transactions?amountLt=1000
http://localhost:8080/transactions?amountEq=1000

or a combination of both:
http://localhost:8080/transactions?amountGt=200&dateRange=lastThreeDays
http://localhost:8080/transactions?amountLt=2000&dateRange=lastMonth

1. Amount and transaction date should be indexed independently since they are to be used to filter queries directly.

General things with how this was implemented:
- Data needs more edge cases for testing.
- Seed data needs sql script
- Query strings allow SQL injection as they are right now. They need to be checked and sanitized carefully.
 Issues regarding this specific feature request:
- The Docker configuration need development and a production environments.

Not a replacement but I would consider adding an ORM to manage data. That way the schema in the database can be modeled
And that way abstract away SQL queries.
I personally consider postgreSQL a more robust relational database system.
